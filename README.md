## What To Install

Node.js
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Run `node -v` in Terminal or Command Prompt to ensure Node.js was installed correctly.

## How To Install React.js and Initialize To Github

Inside of your local "Destination Folder", run the following code:

### `npm install create-react-app`
### `npx create-react-app eth-todo-list-react`
### `cd eth-todo-list-react`

"eth-todo-list-react" will be our "Project Folder". You can change the name if desired.
 
## Create a Github Repository

Following the link:
https://github.com/new

Create a repository the same name as our project: eth-todo-list-react

Since we're importing an existing repository and because create-react-app already gives us a README.md file we can skip all the other steps and click the Create Repository button to continue.

If you already have a repository with this name on Github, you can name this repo whatever you want

## Connecting To Your Remote Repository

Now that we've created a remote repository and because create-react-app initializes a local git repository for us, we can connect our React app to Github really easily!

Commands:

In the terminal in your project directory run the two commands under the section on Github that says "...or push an existing repository from the command line"

1) `git remote add origin ...` connects your project to the remote repository, so you can push and pull code to/from Github,

2) `git push -u origin master` takes the local commit we made in step 1) and pushes it to Github

Refresh your Github page and you should see your create-react-app files!
